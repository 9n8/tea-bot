#Tea Bot Helper

Filters words (like character names or waifus) from a file based on a phrase you input. The best part? It won’t give you the same word twice!

## Features

- **Search by Phrase**: Input a phrase, and the script will find the word.
- **No Repeat Words**: Once a word is used, it won’t be shown again!
- **Clipboard Copy**: The selected word is automatically copied to your clipboard for easy use.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python foo.py
